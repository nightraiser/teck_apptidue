"a premium online restaurant reservation and table management system, today "
"announces its official launch at the New England Food Show. Co-founded by "
"veteran Boston restaurateur Jeffrey Gates and engineer & sales executive Van "
"Garrett, the new system is designed to offer restaurant owners already using "
"an online reservation system with a more cost-effective and robust option "
"than what is currently available on the market as well as provide restaurant "
"owners who were previously priced out of using an online booking system with "
"an option they can finally afford."

"Gates decided to tap into his engineering background to develop an online "
"system after becoming increasingly frustrated with the constant cost "
"increases from the online reservation system he had been using at his six "
"restaurants. In addition, that system had blocked restaurants from using the "
"Internet and prevented them from accessing the system remotely ' from places "
"or on mobile devices other than the costly equipment they required "
"restaurants lease from them in order to use their system. The straw that "
"broke the camel's back was the response that Gates received from his sales "
"representative as he tried to work with them to make their product more user-"
"friendly for a restaurateur running on tight margins. 'If you don't like our "
"system, try something else' was his rep's response ' and so he did!"
